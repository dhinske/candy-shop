Ansible is a configuration management tool, comparable to Chef, Puppet or Salt.
Configuration Management: Using a description for servers to make sure all are in a certain state (packages installed, configuration, services running, permissions etc...), can also be used for deployment processes.
Ansible, like other management tools, uses an own DSL (yaml-Files in this case).
An executable ansible script is called a playbook.
A playbook describes which tasks are executed on which hosts.
