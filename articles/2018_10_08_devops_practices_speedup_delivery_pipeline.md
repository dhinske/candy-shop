- DevOps goal: deliver more frequently to be more responsive to the business
- To get there, understand the value stream, including blockers and wait states
- You need visibility and metrics to understand the value stream
- Treat your delivery pipeline like a product, rather than a disparate set of tools
  - Have a product owner for the delivery pipeline who can own funding and prioritization
  - Use a best-of-breed approach for selecting tools
  - Use standard integration patterns and technologies to integrate tools into your pipeline in the way they were intended
  - Use model-based integration so that your workflow isn't disrupted when you add a different tool
- Architect product value streams
  - Organize teams around value streams
  - Look for ways to eliminate wait states using concepts such as microservices, APIs, and automation
  - Make work and flow visible (defects, technical debt etc...)
  - Measure lead times, including processing and wait times
  - Continuous improvement
- When the product workflow is visible, it is easier to identify bottlenecks
  - Provide automated and self-service capabilities to reduce cycle times
  - Dark launching and feature toggling
  - Inner-sourcing (This allows teams to change code they don't own, using the concept of Git pull requests)
- The key to making these concepts work lies in improving the speed of delivering business value to customers
