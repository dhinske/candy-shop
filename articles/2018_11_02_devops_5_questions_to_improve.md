If you increase the number of builds per day but don't increase the speed at which new products get to market, you have not had an impact. And if you increase code coverage but still release a product filled with bugs, you have not had an impact.

In software delivery, there are five core questions you need to answer to determine whether you are at risk of missing out on potential improvements.
1. Which software applications are the most important for the business?
2. Which projects are most important to do?
3. Do you have the right people in the right place at the right time to support your production systems and deliver your projects?
4. How much technical debt is affecting your production systems, and how is it trending?
5. Which step in software delivery takes the longest, and in which step are the most problems introduced?


- Answer those questions every month.
- Those questions apply on every level of an organization
- Know your people
- Know (Monitor) your technical depth
- Value stream mapping might help with priorization and visualize bottlenecks
