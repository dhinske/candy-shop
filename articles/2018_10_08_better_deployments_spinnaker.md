- Goals
  - Faster Deployments (Seconds or minutes)
  - Safer Deployments
    - Not from developers machine
    - Deploy immutable instances
    - As many automated post-checks as possible


- Spinnaker for Deployment
- Wrapper-API in front of Spinnaker
- CLI and Frontend in front of the Wrapper-API
- Jenkins and Developers use CLI and Frontend for interaction
